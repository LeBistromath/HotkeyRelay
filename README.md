# HotkeyRelay
Activating a USB relay using hotkeys in a Windows computer.

This little program was created for the USB relays found on eBay, a friend wanted to open a cash register by pressing F9 and that's what the program does. The keypress could be read from a configuration file, but it's not done yet.
